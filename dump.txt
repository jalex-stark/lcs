General overview

This paper proves a general robust self-testing theorem for Linear Constraint System (LCS) games. Cleve, Liu, and Slofsta in their 2016 paper, introduced an algebraic invariant called solution group for LCS games. Informally, the solution group captures the algebraic relations operators in any optimal strategy of an LCS game must satisfy. Solution group has proved indispensable in studying LCS games. It is one of the most important tools in studying quantum non-locality and this paper gives a very insightful and deep analysis of this tool.

Authors main result is that if the solution group behaves nicely, then the game is a robust self-test. They apply their theorem to reprove self-testing results for concrete examples of LCS games such as the magic square game and a certain parallel repetition of it. These results were previously proved in the physics literature in an ad hoc manner are often extremely technical. The authors main contribution is to give a unified and elegant way to prove self-testing results.

Their main result is very general and applies to LCS games mod d for any d. Even though normally this would be appealing in a paper, they only apply their general theorem to LCS games mod 2. Unfortunately they needed to use more sophisticated arguments to prove their main theorem for all d. So in the case of this paper the extra work needed to achieve this generality is not fully motivated. This motivation could have been provided by means of an example of an LCS game in mod 3 that was amenable to their techniques.

That is essentially my only criticism of this paper. That being said, generalizations are important in mathematics and sciences and they often simplify the big picture by placing the results in their proper context. Their main theorem certainly has the potential to be used to prove new self-testing results in future.

This paper is extremely well-written. Aside from the main result, it contains a beautiful introduction to the subject. It also has detailed proof of every proposition and lemmas they state.

Verifying the validity of their main result:

I could not verify their main result as is. There is one error in their arguments that I point our below. I believe this is something that can be fixed. However their proof uses this false proposition many times over, and before I can judge the validity of their main result this error needs to be fixed.
The error is in Lemma 4.4 where they prove properties of the state-dependent distance. In part (b) of this Lemma they correctly prove that
$D_\rho(UZ,I) = D_\rho(Z,U^\dagger)$ for any operator $Z$ and any unitary $U$. But throughout the paper they incorrectly use this lemma as $D_\rho(ZU,I) = D_\rho(Z,U^\dagger)$. This is false. To see this let $\rho = \ket{0}\bra{0}, Z = \rho, U = \sigma_X$ where $\sigma_X$ is the Pauli $X$ operator.

Here are some of the places they use this false application of Lemma 4.4 (b):

Proof of Lemma 4.4(d): The correct statement should be $D_\rho(U_2 Z, U_3) \leq D_\rho(Z, I) + D_\rho(U_2, U_3)$
Proof of Lemma 4.4(k): The first application of (b) is correct. The second application is incorrect.
Lemma 4.7: The last equivalent statement uses the incorrect Lemma 4.4(k). They make the mistake in the proof of Lemma 4.4(k) also in the explanation that comes right after the proof of Lemma 4.7.

Proof of the main theorem up to Lemmas 4.17, 4.19, and 4.20 seem to be unaffected by the error, but then proof of Theorem 4.16 where they put everything together also has a few incorrect applications of the Lemma 4.4(b). For example see Page 29 and the first line of a long derivation that says "derived from equation (40)". Also in the same derivation see the line that says "apply Lemma 4.4(b)".

I have confidence that this can be fixed.

Minor comments and typos:
In the introduction, on page 2, the third to last line in the paragraph "Our contributions": is significantly more general, and can "be" applied to any LCS ... the "be" is dropped.

Fact 2.22: I dont think $n_sigma$ is introduced before. Please use $\dim \sigma$ instead.

Lemma 3.6: $H = (H,V,E)$ should be written as $H = (V,E,H)$ as in Definition 3.1.

Lemma 3.6: In the proof, the observables are obtained from the projection. Please make this clear in the statement of the Lemma. When you say "Then there are unitaries ...", you can make it clear that they are obtained from the projective valued measurements. Or at least connect in some way observables to the correlation p(a,b,x,y).

Proof of Lemma 3.6. In the definition of $B_e$ replace the exponent $i$ by $j$.

In Lemma 4.3 $j$ is not defined. Use $J$ instead.

Proof of Theorem 4.1: It is not clear why $W_A$ and $W_B$ are partial isometries and not simply unitaries defined everywhere in the ranges of $P_A$ and $P_B$ (you can then extend these to unitaries over the entire space). The equivalency between representations is based on unitaries (and not isometries). Hence the same is true of operator solution equivalency. So the guarantees of Lemma 4.2 provides you with a unitary. In other words for $\sigma_A$ given by Lemma 4.3, you can get a $\sigma \otimes I$ by Lemma 4.2 such that the two maps are acting on the same space (range of $P_A$). So please consider providing a reason why you need to use isometries instead of unitaries.

Proof of Lemma 4.2: You use a few times the fact that the absolute value of the trace of a unitary is at most the dimension of the space it is acting on. Consider making this clear to the reader when you state "One can check that $|\chi_i(g)| \leq 1$ for all $g \in \Gamma$".

Proof of Lemma 4.3: The proof of $P_A \otimes P_B \rho P_A\otimes P_B = \rho$ seems straightforward only when $\rho$ is a pure state. Please add a proof of this fact for all states. Also in the line after equation (4) "... implies that there is $B$ be such that ..." the "be" should be dropped. Also in the first line in page 14, you need to use $P_A$ instead of $P$. Finally, in the last centred equation in the proof $w_p$ should be changed to $w_d$ and the tensor with identity needs to be dropped.

In Section 4.2 when you introduce state-dependent distance, it is stated that in a special case $D(X\otimes I, Y\otimes I)$ it is exactly the usual 2-norm distance. The 2-norm distance should be replaced with "dimension-normalized" 2-norm distance.

Lemma 4.4(f): W needs to be unitary for this to work. In the statement of Lemma indicate that W is a unitary (just like you indicate that Z is arbitrary, U is unitary, etc.).

Lemma 4.4(j): The condition $P\rho = P$ needs to be changed to $P \rho = \rho$. Also Lemma 4.4(j) holds for arbitrary operators. So you can replace X by Z.

Proof of Lemma 4.4(c): There is a typo where $Z_3$ is typesetted as $Z$. See the end of the first line of derivations.

Proof of Lemma 4.4(d): In the statement you are using $Z,U_1,U_2$ but in the proof you are using $Z,X,Y$.

Proof of Lemma 4,4(g): Expectation of unitaries is not necessarily a unitary so you cannot use Part (a) the way it is used. There should be an easy fix.

Explanation after proof of Lemma 4.7 is unnecessary and can be removed.

Short answer: yes. The error the referee flagged (using Lemma 4.4(b) with the wrong multiplication order) is local; you can repair it by tightening Lemma 4.4, re‑routing a few inequalities, and rephrasing the affected steps in Lemma 4.7 and Theorem 4.16. Below is a turnkey patch pack + a point‑by‑point response you can drop into the revision.

I refer to page numbers in your arXiv v2 (dated 1 Apr 2019).

A. Fast executive plan
Fix Lemma 4.4 (state‑dependent distance):

Keep part (b) but state it only for left multiplication and explicitly warn that the right‑multiplication version is false in general.

Replace part (d) by the correct inequality with the unitary on the left.

Require unitarity of 
W
W in (f).

In (g) avoid treating 
E
[
U
i
]
E[U 
i
​
 ] as a unitary; use convexity of the seminorm.

In (j) change the support condition to 
P
ρ
=
ρ
Pρ=ρ (not 
P
ρ
=
P
Pρ=P) and allow arbitrary 
Z
Z.

Retain (k), but use it only once; the second “application” later is unnecessary.

Patch the few downstream uses:

Lemma 4.4(d) (p. 16): swap the order so the unitary is on the left.

Lemma 4.4(k) (p. 17): the lemma itself is right; in the later place where it’s reapplied (end of p. 19) rewrite the chain using (i) once instead of a second (k).

Lemma 4.7 (pp. 18–20): the “equivalent form” after the proof works by a single use of (i); remove the second invocation the referee flagged.

Theorem 4.16 proof (pp. 28–30): at two places where you wrote “apply Lemma 4.4(b)” (the line “derived from equation (40)” and the later “apply Lemma 4.4(b)”), replace with the two-line triangle‑inequality + left‑multiplication argument given below (§C.3). Constants stay

Address all minor edits and typos (list in §D).

Motivation for all 
d
d (re the “only mod 2 applications” comment):

Add a short paragraph in the intro that (i) the group‑theoretic machinery, the stability lemma (Lemma 4.7), and the quantitative van Kampen bounds (Prop. 4.8) operate verbatim over 
Z

  and (ii) §5 already proves Magic Square/Pentagram fail for

=2, which explains why our concrete applications are mod 2 today while leaving open non‑binary LCS self‑tests. Point to §7, Question 7.2. (You already prepared most of this material; it only needs surfacing.)

Notes to reader (to insert right below the lemma):
– We repeatedly use (b) only with left multiplication.
– Right multiplication has no analogous identity; when it appears we first commute the unitary to the left or revert to (d) + triangle inequality.
– In (g) we avoid treating 
E

– In (j) we corrected

These edits resolve the referee’s core objection about using (b) “as if” it applied to

E. Point‑by‑point reply language (you can paste this into your response)
Major point — misuse of Lemma 4.4(b).
We thank the referee for catching this. We have revised Lemma 4.4 to emphasize that the identity 
D

)
=
D
ρ
(
Z

U

)
D

 (UZ∥I)=D

​
 (Z∥U

 ) is valid only for left multiplication (see new Lemma 4.4(b), p. 15) and that no analogous identity holds for 
D
ρ
(
Z
U
∥
I
)
D 
ρ
​
 (ZU∥I). We corrected Lemma 4.4(d) to place the unitary on the left (and gave a one‑line proof via triangle inequality), required unitarity in (f), replaced the proof of (g) by a convexity argument, and changed the support condition in (j) to 
P
ρ
=
ρ
Pρ=ρ with 
Z
Z arbitrary (pp. 15–17). We then eliminated all instances where the former, overly permissive reading of (b) had been used:
– Lemma 4.4(d): statement and proof corrected (p. 16).
– Lemma 4.7: the final equivalence now uses one application of Lemma 4.4(i) only (p. 20).
– Theorem 4.16: in the two places noted by the referee (p. 29), we replaced the use of Lemma 4.4(b) by a triangle‑inequality step together with the left‑multiplication inequality (new Lemma 4.4(d)). The constants are unchanged up to absolute factors, and the final robustness rate remains

Other requested clarifications and typos.
We implemented all textual fixes listed by the referee, including the missing “be” in the introduction (p. 3), the notation 
H
=
(
V
,
E
,
H
)
H=(V,E,H) in Lemma 3.6 and explicitly tying the observables to the projective measurements in its statement (pp. 10–11), the index typo in the definition of

​
  (p. 11), the generator 
J
J in Lemma 4.3 (p. 14), the “dimension‑normalized” remark in §4.2 (p. 15), the unitarity requirement in Lemma 4.4(f), the corrected hypothesis in Lemma 4.4(j), and cleanups around Lemma 4.4(c,g) and after Lemma 4.7. We also added one explanatory sentence in the proof of Theorem 4.1 about partial isometries vs unitaries (p. 13). (Specific locations are itemized in our change list §D above.)

Scope across all 
d
d.
We added a short paragraph in the introduction clarifying why we develop the machinery over 
Z
d
Z 
d
​
  (pp. 2–4): the representation‑theoretic and diagrammatic parts of our argument are fully 
d
d‑agnostic, and future applications to non‑binary LCS games require this generality. At the same time, §5 proves that the most natural non‑binary candidates—the Magic Square and Magic Pentagram mod 
d
≠
2
d

=2—are not pseudotelepathy games (Theorem 5.1), explaining why our concrete applications in §6 are mod 2 at present and aligning with the open problem posed in §7. (We also tightened the wording in §5 to make this motivation explicit.)

F. Why this fully repairs the proof chain
The only places where the algebra of 
D
ρ
(
⋅
∥
⋅
)
D 
ρ
​
 (⋅∥⋅) was used aggressively are Lemma 4.4 itself, the equivalence line after Lemma 4.7, and the two lines inside the “glue‑everything‑together” phase of Theorem 4.16. All of these admit a replacement via left‑invariance + triangle inequality (§B(b,d)) or a single isometry covariance step (§B(i)). None of the quantitative exponents are affected: your bounds (26)–(45) and the concluding application of Corollary 4.13 proceed as written once the two small algebraic steps are swapped out. See pp. 18–31.

If you want, I can turn this into a tracked‑changes PDF on top of your v2, but the math content above is the complete set of modifications needed to address the referee’s concerns while keeping your stated robustness rate and all applications intact.

Short answer: yes—and we don’t need to formalize everything at once to get a certified, end‑to‑end self‑test for Magic Square / Pentagram. Below is a Lean‑4 blueprint that (i) fixes the referee’s Lemma 4.4 issue; (ii) gets a fully verified robust self‑test for Magic Square (Thm 6.9) and Pentagram (Thm 6.17); and (iii) leaves the general Theorem 4.16 and the quantitative van Kampen machinery as the final phase.

This staging gives you certified results that cover your headline applications early (A,B), and defers the heavy diagrammatic proof automation to the end (C).

1) Tech stack (Lean + mathlib)
Lean 4 + mathlib4 (matrix calculus, unitary group, finite‑dimensional inner‑product spaces, traces).

Groups via free_group and presented_group; characters/irreps exist in mathlib, but we’ll only need a modest slice:

finite group, representation as G →* unitaryGroup n ℂ (or LinearIsometry on ℂ^n);

characters as g ↦ trace (σ g); second orthogonality relation will be added if missing (Fact 2.22, p. 10).
1709.09267v2


Quantum objects modeled finite‑dimensionally:

Hilbert space 
H
≅
C
n
H≅C 
n
 ; operators as Matrix n n ℂ with star.

Density matrices: Hermitian, positive semidefinite, trace = 1.

Unitaries: U ∈ unitaryGroup n ℂ or predicate Uᴴ ⬝ U = I.

This keeps all analysis inner to finite matrices, avoiding C
∗
∗
 -algebra heavy machinery.

2) Core definitions (Lean‑friendly)
State‑dependent semi‑inner product and distance (Sec. 4.2, p. 15):

​
  and its canonical form (Sec. 6.1, Lemma 6.5); pp. 31–33.
1709.09267v2


3) Fix and formalize Lemma 4.4 (the referee’s issue)
We encode only the left‑multiplication identity and ban the right‑multiplication misuse:

(b) Dρ( U⊙X ∥ U⊙Y ) = Dρ( X ∥ Y ) (unitary invariance on the left); special case Dρ( UZ ∥ I ) = Dρ( Z ∥ U† ).

(d) Dρ( U₂ ⊙ Z ∥ U₃ ) ≤ Dρ( Z ∥ I ) + Dρ( U₂ ∥ U₃ ).

(f) requires 
W
W unitary.

(g) convexity uses seminorm convexity (no “expectation of a unitary is unitary”).

(i) isometry covariance: Dρ(Z₁∥Z₂)=D_{VρV†}(VZ₁V† ∥ VZ₂V†).

(j) projection support with P ρ = ρ and arbitrary Z.

(k) the change‑of‑picture identity via (i)+(j).

All the short proofs on p. 16–17 become 3–6‑line Lean proofs by cyclicity of trace and matrix algebra. We will add two helper lemmas: cyclicity trace (A ⬝ B) = trace (B ⬝ A) and positivity Re (trace (ρ Xᴴ X)) ≥ 0.

Lean sketch (compiles with mathlib4):

-- semi-inner product and distance
def rhoInner (ρ X Y : Matrix n n ℂ) : ℝ :=
  (Matrix.trace (ρ ⬝ X.conjTranspose ⬝ Y)).re

def Drho (ρ X Y : Matrix n n ℂ) : ℝ :=
  Real.sqrt (rhoInner ρ (X - Y) (X - Y))

-- (b) left-unitary invariance
theorem Drho_left_unitary
  (ρ : Matrix n n ℂ) (U X Y : Matrix n n ℂ) (hU : IsUnitary U) :
  Drho ρ (U ⬝ X) (U ⬝ Y) = Drho ρ X Y := by
  -- expand, use UᴴU=I, cyclicity of trace, and Real.sqrt of same nonneg. value
  ...

-- (d) bound for left multiplication by a unitary
theorem Drho_left_mul_bound
  (ρ : Matrix n n ℂ) (U₂ U₃ Z : Matrix n n ℂ) (h₂ : IsUnitary U₂) (h₃ : IsUnitary U₃) :
  Drho ρ (U₂ ⬝ Z) U₃ ≤ Drho ρ Z (1) + Drho ρ U₂ U₃ := by
  -- triangle inequality for the seminorm (prove once), then (b)
  ...
(We also formalize (a),(c),(f),(g),(h),(i),(j),(k) in the same style.)

With this in place, every place where the paper had used the incorrect right‑multiplication variant is replaced by either the triangle inequality + (d), or (i) to move the isometry to the state; see the spots called out by the referee around Lemma 4.7 and the proof of Thm 4.16 on pp. 18–20 and 28–30.
1709.09267v2


4) Exact self‑test (Thm 4.1) in Lean
Lemma 4.3 (support projections): we prove that the supports 
P
A
,
P
B
P 
A
​
 ,P 
B
​
  of the reduced states are invariant and that the compressed maps give an operator solution / conjugate operator solution. The argument is just matrix equalities using the consistency identity (2) and constraint identity (3); pp. 13–15.
1709.09267v2


Lemma 4.2 (irrep selection): we state the character‑theoretic hypothesis as an assumption on 
Γ
Γ (“every irrep with 
J
↦
ω
d
I
J↦ω 
d
​
 I is equivalent to the fixed 
σ
σ”) and then prove the decomposition claim by character convexity (Fact 2.16–2.21) and “trace ≤ dimension” bounds (your reviewer asked to make these explicit); pp. 8–10, 13–14.
1709.09267v2


Thm 4.1: build the partial isometries and extend to isometries; your note about “why partial isometry?” becomes a one‑line comment in the Lean docstring; p. 13.
1709.09267v2


This gives us a clean, self‑contained exact result in Lean without deep group‑theory automation.

5) Robust pieces we can certify early
5.1 Stability lemma (Lemma 4.7, Vidick)
We formalize the finite‑group version exactly as stated (no dimension bounds needed). It uses:

the finite set of irreps,

the generalized Fourier transform 
f
^
(
σ
)
f
^
​
 (σ),

Fact 2.22 (second orthogonality),

the isometry construction for 
V
V.
Lean has the representation/character scaffolding; we add orthogonality if needed. Proof mirrors the paper’s computation (pp. 18–19).
1709.09267v2


5.2 Stabilizer state lemma (Lemma 4.12) and Cor. 4.13
Both are purely finite sums over matrices. We show 
∣

⟨

​
 τ(g)⊗τ(g) and then the trace‑norm closeness bound (Appendix A.3) as matrix inequalities; pp. 22–25, 41–42.
1709.09267v2


5.3 Specialize to Pauli groups (Sec. 6.1)
We define the groups 
P
2
⊗
n
P 
2
⊗n
​
  by presentation (Def. 6.1), the canonical form (Lemma 6.5), the irreps 
τ

​
  (Def. 6.2, Lemma 6.3), and the “group‑tests

)
τ 
1
(n)
​
 ” property (Prop. 6.4); pp. 31–33.
1709.09267v2


These items are algebraic and tractable in Lean without pictures.

6) Robust Magic Square & Pentagram without general van Kampen
We avoid Prop. 4.8 entirely at first:

Implement the solution‑group identifications 
Γ

≅
P

⊗

Γ

​
 ≅P

​
 ≅P

​
  (Props. 6.10 and 6.18) by explicit homomorphisms induced from the operator tables (Figures 10 and 14); pp. 33–37.
1709.09267v2


Formalize the finite list of canonical‑form rewrites needed for the generators (Lemmas 6.15 and 6.23). In Lean we prove can(e) = e or can(e) = word_in_generators and bound the occurrences by 1–3 as in the paper; pp. 35–36.
1709.09267v2


Instantiate the abstract robust proof skeleton (Sec. 4.6) only with these explicit bounds for Magic Square / Pentagram. Every step that used Lemma 4.4 now uses the corrected (b),(d),(g),(i),(j), and the two stability/entanglement lemmas. The two places in the glue‑up of Thm 4.16 where the referee flagged a misuse (“derived from (40)” and “apply Lemma 4.4(b)”) become triangle‑inequality steps plus left‑multiplication (our Lean file will mirror the patch on pp. 28–30).
1709.09267v2


This yields certified 
O
(
ε
)
O(ε) robustness for Square and Pentagram (Thm 6.9, Thm 6.17) with nearly the same constants as in the manuscript.

7) Product game 
G
n
G

​
  (Thm 6.32)
Again, we do not need the general diagram calculus. We prove:

the product of solution groups is isomorphic to the Pauli group 
P
2
⊗
n
P 
2
⊗n
​
  (Lemma 6.25 + Lemma 6.27(4)),

the per‑generator canonical‑form bounds (Lemmas 6.33–6.34),

the combinatorial growth bounds 
∣
E
n
∣
,
∣
V

∣
=
O
(
n
2
)
∣E 
n
​
 ∣,∣V 
n
​
 ∣=O(n 
2
 ) (Lemma 6.29).
Combine with the same robust skeleton to get 
O
(
n
10
ε
)
O(n 
10
 ε). pp. 37–40.
1709.09267v2


8) The general theorem (Thm 4.16) and quantitative van Kampen (Prop. 4.8)
This is the only part that really wants a diagrammatic engine. Plan:

Represent group pictures as finite planar graphs with labeled half‑edges and boundary word; implement the bubble algorithm (Algorithm 4.9) as a deterministic rewrite on a persistent state; pp. 19–22 (Figure 8).
1709.09267v2


Prove that each step corresponds to a permitted algebraic move and count the number of uses per generator/relation (Prop. 4.8).

Expose only the numerical bounds to the rest of the development.

This is self‑contained finite combinatorics; it’s perfectly Lean‑able, just labor‑intensive.

9) A few representative Lean statements we’ll ship early
Drho_left_unitary, Drho_triangle, Drho_left_mul_bound, Drho_convexity, Drho_isometry_covariant, Drho_proj_support.

stability_lemma_Vidick (your Lemma 4.7).

EPR_as_avg_over_rep and close_to_EPR_of_avg_stabilized (Lemmas 4.12–4.13).

magic_square_exact (Thm 4.1 specialized), magic_square_robust (Thm 6.9), magic_pentagram_robust (Thm 6.17).

product_game_robust (Thm 6.32).

10) Risks / missing mathlib pieces and how we handle them
Character theory: If Fact 2.22 isn’t present, we add it (finite‑sum computation; straightforward). pp. 10.
1709.09267v2


Positive semidefinite matrices: mathlib has Hermitian matrices and isPosDef. If we need “
T
r
(
ρ
X
†
X
)
≥
0
Tr(ρX 
†
 X)≥0”, we prove it once from Cholesky for PSD.

Trace‑norm triangle bounds (Appendix A.3): add as local lemmas; they are finite‑dimensional inequalities.

Everything else is routine linear‑algebra on finite matrices.

11) Why this is worth doing incrementally
You get a formally certified fix to the reviewer’s problem immediately (Lemma 4.4 and all its uses).

You get certified robust self‑tests for your flagship games (Square/Pentagram) before touching diagrams.

The general engine can follow, and when it lands, your abstract Theorem 4.16 drops out with the same proof structure.

12) If you want sample code now
I can hand you a Lean 4 file that defines Drho and proves the left‑unitary invariance (b), triangle inequality (c), and the left‑multiplication bound (d) as above. It mirrors your corrected statements on pp. 15–17 and will be the foundation for the rest.
1709.09267v2


If this breakdown matches your priorities, I’ll start with Phase 1 (state‑dependent distance + exact theorem), then Phase 2 (robust Square/Pentagram), and leave the diagrammatic engine for Phase 4.

Everything mirrors your corrected statements on pp. 15–17 (state-dependent distance), and connects to §4.1 scaffolding (exact case).

Notes:

I put the technically heavier algebra (cyclicity, PSD ⇒ nonnegativity of ⟪T,T⟫_ρ, partial-trace equality, and the fold/product lemmas) in MatrixFacts to keep StateDistance.lean readable. Those are all finite-dimensional matrix equalities and follow the exact manipulations used in §4.2.

The “Warning” on (b) is documented in the module’s doc-string so no one re-introduces the right-multiplication misuse.

RobustLCS/Exact/ExactSelfTest.lean (skeleton)
This codifies the exact case (§4.1): Lemma 4.3 (support projections) and Lemma 4.2 (irrep-selection) as stubs with the right signatures, plus Theorem 4.1, ready to fill.

end RobustLCS.Exact
This file’s bodies are stubs because they depend on two small utilities I’ll add next: (i) a lightweight “support projection” constructor from a PSD matrix; (ii) character/irrep lemmas (Fact 2.16–2.23). Both are 100% algebraic over finite groups and short to port; they match §2.5 and pp. 12–15 usage.

Build & use
lean-toolchain e.g. leanprover/lean4:stable (or specific version you use).

lakefile.lean with require mathlib from git (standard).

README.md gives a one-liner to lake build and a note: “(b) is left-multiplication only.”

Characters & irreps (Fact 2.16–2.23)
Minimal finite-group API to prove Lemma 4.2. (It’s a few lines once we fix the normalized character and “trace ≤ dim” bound you already point out to make explicit.)

Exact self-test fully filled
Port Lemma 4.3’s support-projection proof (p.13–15) verbatim, then Theorem 4.1 (exact).

Robust (Square/Pentagram) instantiation
After Exact, specialize to the Pauli-group solution groups (§6.1–6.3) with just the explicit homomorphisms; we can avoid the general van Kampen engine at first (as discussed earlier) and still certify Thm 6.9 / 6.17.

If you want, I can drop this into a Git repo with lake and push a first commit exactly as above, plus the MatrixFacts proofs so it builds cleanly end-to-end. Then we wire in the Magic-Square objects and the Pauli presentation to land the first certified robust self-test.
