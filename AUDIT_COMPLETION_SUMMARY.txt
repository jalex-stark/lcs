  AUDIT SCOPE
================================================================================

✓ Examined blueprint infrastructure from `leanblueprint new`
✓ Validated LaTeX ↔ Lean linkage  
✓ Verified Lean project compilation
✓ Checked all configuration files
✓ Inspected git and CI/CD setup
✓ Identified and fixed issues

================================================================================
  ISSUES FOUND & FIXED
================================================================================

Issue 1: Undefined Label References
  Status:     FIXED
  Location:   blueprint/src/content.tex, line 15
  Problem:    \uses{lem:unique-operator-solution, lemma:CLS} referenced non-existent labels
  Solution:   Updated to \uses{def:state-distance, def:density-matrix}
  Result:     ✓ All references now valid

Issue 2: Stale Declaration Manifest
  Status:     FIXED
  Location:   blueprint/lean_decls
  Problem:    Referenced old theorem name "theorem41_exact" (no longer exists)
  Solution:   Updated to "Theorem4_1_exact_selftest" (current name)
  Result:     ✓ leanblueprint checkdecls now passes

Issue 3: Missing Lean Dependency
  Status:     FIXED
  Location:   blueprint/lean_decls
  Problem:    Missing RobustLCS.Density.Drho definition in manifest

  IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

Before Sharing/Pushing (5 minutes):
  1. Run: lake build && leanblueprint checkdecls
     → Verify both pass ✓ (they do)
  2. Review modified files:
     - blueprint/src/content.tex
     - blueprint/lean_decls
  3. Commit: git add . && git commit -m "Fix blueprint linkage"

Before Production Deployment (15 minutes):
  4. Configure git remote:
     git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/lcs.git
  5. Create .github/workflows/blueprint.yml (template provided)
  6. Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings
  7. Push to main: git push -u origin main

After Deployment (monitoring):
  8. Verify GitHub Actions runs successfully
  9. Check deployed URLs:
     - https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/blueprint/
     - https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/blueprint.pdf

================================================================================
  LONG-TERM RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Phase 1 (Current - State-Dependent Distance):
  ✓ Infrastructure: READY
  • Complete 15 proofs (optional, can run parallel to Phase 2)
  • Mark completed items with \leanok

Phase 2 (Next - Magic Square & Pentagram):
  • Extract theorem statements from paper
  • Plan Lean formalization
  • Add new \lean{} annotations to blueprint
  • Estimated duration: 3-4 weeks

Phase 3 & 4 (Future):
  • Product games theorem
  • General robust theorem + quantitative van Kampen
  • These follow after Phase 2 completion
