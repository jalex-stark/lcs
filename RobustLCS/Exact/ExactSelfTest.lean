# Exact Self-Testing Framework

This file develops the exact self-testing results from Chapter 4 of the paper.
The main result is Theorem 4.1, which uses solution group representations and
support projections to establish uniqueness of optimal strategies (up to isometry).

## Main results (Phase 1 stubs)

* `Lemma4_2_irrep_selection`: Character theory to select irreducible representations
* `Lemma4_3_support_projections`: Minimal projections on support of density
* `Theorem4_1_exact_selftest`: Main exact self-testing theorem with uniqueness

    Given a solution group Γ = ⟨G | R_c, R_eq⟩ and a one-dimensional representation ω_d,
    determine when an irreducible representation π contains ω_d and extract support projector.
    Proof deferred to character theory module.

    For a density ρ_AB and irrep decomposition on Γ-module, minimal projection P

    Proof uses support projection properties and density operator theory.

/-- **Theorem 4.1** (Exact self-testing for optimal strategies).
    If a solution group Γ has a unique irreducible representation π with ω_d entry J ↦ ω_d I,
    then any strategy (ρ_AB, {A_x}, {B_y}) winning the LCS game is unique up to isometry:
    the observables are unitarily equivalent to the standard π-representation.
    Proof combines Lemma 4.2 and 4.3 with density covariance properties.
